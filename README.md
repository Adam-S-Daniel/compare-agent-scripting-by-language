# compare-agent-scripting-by-language

Benchmarks how well agents perform scripting tasks when asked to use various languages (and when not asked to use a particular language). **[Latest results](results/2026-04-09_152435/results.md)** | [All results](#benchmark-runs)

## Benchmark Versions

### [v1](benchmark-instructions-v1.md) — Baseline

First benchmark run. 18 general scripting tasks (data transformation, text processing, file manipulation, etc.) across 4 language modes: `default`, `powershell`, `powershell-strict`, `csharp-script`. 2 models (Opus, Sonnet). 144 total runs. Every task prompt requires red/green TDD with mocks. No syntax hooks. Tasks 11-18 have GitHub Actions themes but only produce standalone scripts.

### [v2](benchmark-instructions-v2.md) — Refined Prompts

Same 18 tasks and 4 modes as v1, with improved prompt wording. Partially completed (111/144 runs) before being superseded by v3.

### [v3](benchmark-instructions-v3.md) — GitHub Actions Workflows

Narrowed to 8 tasks (11-18, all GHA-category). Changed modes to `default`, `powershell`, `bash`, `typescript-bun`. Each task now requires a working `.github/workflows/*.yml` file that passes `actionlint` and executes in Docker via `act`. All agent tests must run through the workflow pipeline. PostToolUse syntax/lint hooks enabled on all runs. 64 total runs.

### [v4](benchmark-instructions-v4.md) — Trap-Aware Guidance

Same tasks, modes, and models as v3. Added "Common Pitfalls" section derived from v3 trap analysis. `shell: pwsh` guidance for PowerShell mode. "Limit to 3 act push runs" instruction. Custom act container with pwsh/Pester pre-installed (`Dockerfile.act`). Cut average run time by 24% vs v3. 64 total runs, zero failures.

## What it Tests

Each benchmark version defines a set of scripting tasks, language modes, and models. Agents receive only a prompt — no conversation context or prior results. Each run produces scripts, tests, and (in v3+) GitHub Actions workflows. Results are evaluated on:

- Whether the agent's own tests pass
- Code quality metrics (errors, turns, cost)
- Actionlint validation and act execution (v3+)
- PostToolUse hook effectiveness (v3+)
- Trap detection and analysis (v3+)

## Running a Benchmark

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/compare-agent-scripting-by-language.git
cd compare-agent-scripting-by-language

# Ensure claude CLI is installed and authenticated
# Then run:
./run-benchmark.sh
```

To resume a crashed/interrupted run:
```bash
./run-benchmark.sh --resume 2026-04-02_181500
```

To regenerate all results reports:
```bash
python3 generate_results.py --all
```

## Test Quality Evaluation

After a benchmark run, evaluate the quality of agent-generated test suites:

```bash
# Structural metrics only (fast, no LLM calls)
python3 test_quality.py results/2026-04-09_152435

# LLM-as-judge (requires a provider — default: claude-cli)
python3 test_quality.py --llm-judge --provider claude-cli results/2026-04-09_152435
```

Structural metrics count tests, assertions, and test-to-code ratios across Python, TypeScript, PowerShell, and Bash. The LLM-as-judge sends each run's code and tests to an LLM for scoring on four dimensions (1-5 scale):

- **Coverage**: Do tests exercise the key requirements?
- **Rigor**: Edge cases, error handling, boundary conditions?
- **Design**: Test organization, fixtures, readability?
- **Overall**: Holistic quality — primary ranking metric.

LLM judge results are cached per run (in `test-quality-llm.json`), so subsequent evaluations skip already-scored runs.

## Adding LLM Providers

The LLM-as-judge uses a pluggable provider system (`llm_providers.py`). The benchmark runner (`runner.py`) is inherently Claude CLI-based (it tests CLI features), but the evaluation layer is provider-agnostic.

**Current providers:**
- `claude-cli` — pre-authenticated Claude Code CLI. No API key or secrets needed.

**To add a new provider** (e.g., Anthropic API with key, OpenAI, Codex CLI):

1. Open `llm_providers.py`.
2. Create a class inheriting from `LLMProvider`.
3. Implement `is_available()` and `judge(system_prompt, user_message, model)`.
4. Register it in the `PROVIDERS` dict.
5. Use it: `python3 test_quality.py --llm-judge --provider your-provider`.

See the docstring in [`llm_providers.py`](llm_providers.py) for a complete skeleton example.
