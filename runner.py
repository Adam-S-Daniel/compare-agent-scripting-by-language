GHA_WORKFLOW_ADDENDUM = """
GITHUB ACTIONS REQUIREMENT:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at .github/workflows/{task_slug}.yml that uses
your script in a real CI/CD pipeline. The workflow must:
- Use appropriate trigger events (push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch, etc.)
- Reference your script correctly
- Pass actionlint validation (valid YAML, valid action references, correct syntax)
- Include appropriate permissions, environment variables, and job dependencies
- Actually run successfully when executed locally with `act` (nektos/act)

Design your workflow so its steps work in an isolated Docker container — use
`actions/checkout@v4`, install dependencies your script needs, and run it.
Avoid steps requiring external services or secrets without sensible defaults.

IMPORTANT for PowerShell mode: Use `shell: pwsh` on your workflow run: steps instead
of invoking `pwsh -Command` or `pwsh -File` from bash. This avoids escaping issues
and works correctly in act containers. pwsh and Pester are pre-installed in the
container.

WORKFLOW VALIDATION:
Run `actionlint .github/workflows/{task_slug}.yml` and fix any errors. actionlint is
pre-installed. Iterate until it passes cleanly. Validate with actionlint BEFORE
running act — actionlint is instant, act takes 30-90 seconds per run.

ALL TESTS MUST RUN THROUGH ACT:
Every single test case must execute through the GitHub Actions workflow via `act`.
Do NOT test your script directly — all testing goes through the pipeline.

Structure your workflow to accept test fixture data and produce verifiable output.
Your test harness must:
1. For each test case: set up a temp git repo with your project files + that case's
   fixture data, run `act push --rm`, capture the output
2. Save all act output to `act-result.txt` in the current working directory (append
   each test case's output, clearly delimited)
3. Assert that act exited with code 0 for each case
4. Parse the act output and assert on EXACT EXPECTED VALUES — not just that output
   appeared, but that it matches the known-good result for that test case's input.
   For example: if your workflow bumps version 1.1.0 with a feat commit, assert
   the output contains exactly "1.2.0", not just "a version number"
5. Assert every job shows "Job succeeded"

The `act-result.txt` file MUST exist when done. It is a required artifact.
`act` and Docker are pre-installed. Limit yourself to at most 3 `act push` runs —
diagnose errors from the output rather than re-running blindly.

WORKFLOW STRUCTURE TESTS (also required):
- Parse the YAML and check expected structure (triggers, jobs, steps)
- Verify the workflow references your script files correctly (paths exist)
- Verify actionlint passes (assert exit code 0)
