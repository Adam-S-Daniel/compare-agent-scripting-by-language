# All costs in USD per million tokens. Source: https://claude.com/pricing
# cache_write is the 5-minute TTL rate (1.25x base input). 1-hour TTL cache
# writes are documented as 2x base input but Anthropic appears to bill Claude
# Code CLI cache creation at the 5m rate regardless of TTL tag (confirmed
# empirically against a probe run on claude-opus-4-7[1m] — reported cost
# matched 5m-rate math to the penny).
# `[1m]` variants extend the context window to 1M tokens; the pricing docs
# state pricing "applies uniformly regardless of context length", so these
# entries mirror the base-model rates.
# These are assumption fields — the CLI's reported `total_cost_usd` is the
# authoritative per-run cost and is what appears in results.md.
