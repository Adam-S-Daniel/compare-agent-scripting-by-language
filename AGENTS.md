# Agent Instructions

All agent-facing instructions live in this file. `CLAUDE.md` contains only a
reference here. If you are a Claude Code agent, you have already loaded this
via `CLAUDE.md`. Other agents: read this file directly.

## Build and test

```bash
# Run unit tests (REQUIRED before every PR)
pip install pytest  # if not already installed
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Validate imports
python3 -c "from runner import main"
python3 -c "from generate_results import generate_results_md"
python3 -c "from test_quality import compute_structural_metrics"
python3 -c "from llm_providers import get_provider"

# Regenerate all reports
python3 generate_results.py --all

# Run a benchmark (v4, all tasks/modes/models)
python3 runner.py --tasks 11,12,13,15,16,17,18 --modes default,powershell,bash,typescript-bun --models opus,sonnet

# Evaluate test quality (structural metrics only)
python3 test_quality.py results/2026-04-09_152435

# Evaluate test + deliverable quality with the default panel of judges
# (Haiku 4.5 via claude-cli + Gemini 3.1 Pro via gemini-cli). Each judge
# writes its own cache file: test-quality-{short}.json and
# deliverable-quality-{short}.json. 8-worker thread pool by default;
# bump `--workers` if your CLIs + account limits allow more concurrency.
python3 test_quality.py --llm-judge --deliverable-judge \
    --judges haiku45,gemini31pro --workers 8 results/2026-04-17_004319

# Re-evaluate with a single judge only (useful for bias cross-checks)
python3 test_quality.py --llm-judge --judges haiku45 results/2026-04-17_004319

# Build custom act container (optional, eliminates pwsh install overhead)
docker build -t act-ubuntu-pwsh:latest -f Dockerfile.act .
```

## Code style

- Python 3.12+. No type stubs or mypy. Use type hints where they aid readability.
- Dollar amounts in results.md: round to nearest penny (`.2f`).
- Durations in results.md: always in minutes with 1 decimal (`{seconds/60:.1f}min`).
- No emojis in code or docs unless the user asks.

## Terminology

When the runtime wrapper uses `language_mode` (Python-side variable name), the
*user-facing* axis is called **language**, never "mode". This covers docs,
prompts, report prose, and LLM summaries. The internal field name stays
`language_mode` so existing metrics.json readers don't break; everything else
says "language" (e.g. "default/Python, bash, powershell, powershell-tool,
typescript-bun"). Rationale: "mode" is ambiguous with agent-approval-modes and
execution modes; "language" is the concept readers expect.

## Repository rules

- **No agent-generated `.github/workflows/` at repo root.** Agent workflows only exist inside workspaces under `workspaces/`. The repo's own CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is the exception.
- **Never fix agent-generated code.** The benchmark measures autonomous output. Do not manually fix, edit, or patch workflow files in `workspaces/` or `results/*/generated-code/`.
- **`runner.py` observes and records, never intervenes** on agent code or errors.
- **Workspaces are throwaway.** Don't commit `workspaces/` contents.
- **`results/` is committed.** It contains archived metrics, generated code, and transcripts.
- **`CLAUDE.md` is only a pointer.** All instructions go in `AGENTS.md`. Never put substantive content in `CLAUDE.md` — it should only reference this file.

## Architecture

### Key files

- `models.py` — single source of truth for model IDs and token pricing. Update here when Anthropic changes prices.
- `runner.py` — benchmark harness. Runs agents via `claude -p`, collects metrics, pushes results. Imports from `models.py` and `generate_results.py`.
- `generate_results.py` — generates `results.md` reports and updates `README.md`. Can run standalone: `python3 generate_results.py --all`.
- `test_quality.py` — test + deliverable quality evaluation. Structural metrics (always) + panel-of-judges LLM evaluation (`--llm-judge` for test-quality judge, `--deliverable-judge` for workflow+scripts judge). The default panel is Haiku 4.5 + Gemini 3.1 Pro (configured in the module-level `JUDGES` dict). Each judge writes its own per-run cache file; `load_panel_scores(variant_dir, kind)` reads them and returns a mean-aggregated score dict for the reporting layer. Legacy single-Sonnet `*-llm.json` caches still read for backward compat. Imported by `generate_results.py` for the "Test Quality Evaluation" section.
- `llm_providers.py` — pluggable LLM provider abstraction for evaluation tasks (see "Adding LLM providers" below). Currently registered: `claude-cli` (pre-authenticated Claude Code CLI), `gemini-cli` (pre-authenticated Gemini CLI, bypasses billing gate), `gemini-api` (google-genai SDK, requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` and a paid-tier Google AI Studio account).
- `benchmark-instructions-v*.md` — per-version specs given to agents during runs.
- `hooks/syntax-check.py` — PostToolUse hook for syntax/lint checking.
- `Dockerfile.act` — custom act container image with pwsh + Pester pre-installed. Build with `docker build -t act-ubuntu-pwsh:latest -f Dockerfile.act .`. Runner.py auto-detects it and injects `.actrc` into workspaces.
- `skills/` — agent skills following [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) spec.

### Adding new trap detectors

See the docstring on `_detect_traps()` in `generate_results.py`. Each trap needs:
a kebab-case name, detection logic over bash_cmds/console/metrics, a time estimate,
and an entry in `trap_applicable_mode` if mode-specific.

### LLM vs structural discrepancy checks

After every report generation (`python3 generate_results.py --all`), check the
"LLM vs Structural Discrepancies" section in each `results.md`. Discrepancies
are auto-classified by `_find_discrepancies()` in `generate_results.py`:

- **counter-gap**: structural metrics are implausibly low (e.g. 0 tests or 0
  assertions while LLM scores high). This means `test_quality.py` is missing a
  test pattern. **Fix the counter** — read the generated test files to identify
  the pattern the counter doesn't recognize, add it to the appropriate
  `_count_*()` function and the detection/classification patterns, add unit
  tests, and regenerate. Counter-gap discrepancies should not persist across PRs.
- **qualitative**: structural metrics look reasonable but the LLM disagrees on
  quality. The report includes the LLM's justification (from the `summary`
  field in `test-quality-llm.json`). These are expected and acceptable — review
  the justification to confirm it's coherent, then leave them.

If a **new counter-gap** appears after changing `test_quality.py`, it's a
regression. Fix it before merging.

### Combined-report invariants (`combine_results.py`)

The combined report (e.g. `results/results_<dirA>__<dirB>.md`) pools
runs across multiple source directories. A few layout invariants must
hold — changes here have broken the generated markdown before, so
`tests/test_combine_results.py` guards them:

- **No duplicate `(language, variant_disp)` rows in Tiers or
  Comparison.** `aggregate_rows` groups by `(language_mode,
  model_short, effort_level)` only. CLI versions pool into one row;
  `cli_versions` on the row retains the per-CLI breakdown for the
  legend to consume. (Previously the aggregate split by CLI, which
  rendered as duplicate-looking rows whose Model column matched.)
- **CLI Version Legend schema.** Exactly one CLI version per row.
  Columns: `Variant label | CLI version | Tasks | Languages`. `Tasks`
  and `Languages` each hold either `All` (pair covered every task /
  every language observed in the report) or a comma-sorted subset.
  The plural header `CLI version(s)` and comma-joined version cells
  are the old layout — do not reintroduce.
- **Section order in the body:** Scoring → Conclusions → **Judge
  Consistency Summary** → Tiers → Comparison → Per-Run → Notes. JCS
  is a top-level `##`, not a `### ` under Notes, because readers
  benefit from the panel-health verdict before they consume
  rankings.
- **Quality-score lookup key.** The per-variant score bucket is keyed
  by `(language_mode, _label(m))` which includes the `-cli<ver>`
  suffix; aggregate lookups must therefore use `r["variant_with_cli"]`
  (not `r["variant"]`). A prior regression where the lookup used the
  CLI-less `variant` caused every aggregate Tests Quality / Workflow
  Craft cell to render as `—` despite per-run scores being present.

### Where the Conclusions prose lives

The max-effort Opus `## Conclusions` block is produced **only for
the combined cross-run report** (`combine_results.py`), not for
per-run `results.md` files. `generate_results.py` still invokes the
JCS Summary LLM call (cheap) but passes `speed_cost_input=None` so
`conclusions_report.generate_conclusions_from_inputs` short-circuits
the Conclusions call. Reasoning: comparing a single run directory
against itself doesn't surface tradeoffs worth ~$1 of max-effort
tokens per regen — the Conclusions prose only reads as useful when
multiple run dirs are being compared.

If you need per-run prose for some new purpose, plumb through a
separate prompt; do not re-enable the merged Conclusions call at the
single-run site.

### Judge rationale audit (`judge_audit.py`)

The combined report includes a `## Judge Audit Outcomes` section
that lists every run where the panel judges span ≥ 4 points on a
1–5 scale (i.e. Haiku = 1, Gemini = 5). For each flagged row the
audit scans each judge's rationale for concrete file-existence
claims (see `MISSING_PHRASES` + file-extension regex) and resolves
them against the run's `generated-code/` tree. Drop rule:

- One judge contradicted → drop that judge's score; panel mean
  becomes the other judge's number.
- Both contradicted → drop both; panel mean becomes `—` and the
  row is excluded from aggregates.
- Neither contradicted → keep both.

Verdicts persist as `judge-audit-<kind>.json` next to each run's
judge caches. `test_quality.load_panel_scores` consumes the verdict
automatically, so the Tiers / Comparison / LLM-as-Judge tables
above honor the audit with no extra plumbing.

### Per-judge prompt addendums

`JUDGES[...]` in `test_quality.py` accepts a `prompt_addendum_tests`
key. The test-quality evaluator appends it to the shared rubric for
that judge alone, so a model-specific steer (e.g. Haiku's
missing-file sanity note) doesn't drag the other judges along.
`python3 test_quality.py --rejudge haiku45 <run_dir>` refreshes
only that judge's cache — handy after tweaking its addendum.

### Combined-report parity with per-run reports

Per-run `results.md` carries three top-level sections the combined
report does not yet replicate in full:

| Per-run section                  | Combined report status |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `## Failed / Timed-Out Runs`     | Ported (2026-04-21)    |
| `## Test Quality Evaluation`     | Partial — structural metrics + panel LLM-as-Judge table ported; Correlation and LLM-vs-Structural Discrepancies sub-tables still absent |
| `## Savings Analysis` (Hook / Trap / Cache savings) | **Not yet ported.** Depends on per-run hook telemetry + `_detect_traps` output that aren't currently threaded into `combine_results.py`. Readers needing savings data should drop into the per-run `results.md` for now. |

When porting the remaining bits, factor the section builders out of
`generate_results.py` into module-level helpers so both entry
points share a single implementation — the duplication we'd
otherwise accrue would drift the two reports out of sync.

### Judge consistency summary (prompt hygiene)

`JUDGE_CONSISTENCY_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in
`judge_consistency_report.py` forbids unexplained shorthand. If you
surface disagreement rows, introduce them with the plain-language gap
size (e.g. "the widest disagreements — a judge scoring 1 vs 5, a
4-point gap on a 1–5 scale — include …"). Do not coin abbreviations
("Span-N", "Δ-N", etc.) that a reader has to decode. Cite specific
runs as `task-id-name / language / model-variant` (the same triple
the Per-Run table uses).

Follow-up analyses of flagged disagreement rows live under
`results/analysis/` as dated standalone markdown files (e.g.
`judge_disagreement_1-vs-5_2026-04-21.md`). Link them from the JCS
section when regenerating if they remain relevant.

### Updating model pricing

Edit `models.py`. Check https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models and
https://www.anthropic.com/pricing. Then run `python3 generate_results.py --all`.

### Regenerating reports

After changing `generate_results.py`, run:
```bash
python3 generate_results.py --all
```
This regenerates `results.md` for every run directory and updates `README.md`.

### Adding LLM providers

The LLM-as-judge evaluation in `test_quality.py` uses a pluggable provider
system defined in `llm_providers.py`. The benchmark runner (`runner.py`) is
inherently tied to the Claude Code CLI (it tests CLI-specific features), but
the evaluation layer is provider-agnostic.

To add a new provider (e.g., Anthropic API, OpenAI, Codex CLI):

1. Open `llm_providers.py` and create a class inheriting from `LLMProvider`.
2. Implement `is_available()` — return True when the provider can be used.
3. Implement `judge(system_prompt, user_message, model)` — return
   `{"text": str, "cost_usd": float, "input_tokens": int, "output_tokens": int}`.
4. Register it in the `PROVIDERS` dict at the bottom of the file.
5. Use it: `python3 test_quality.py --llm-judge --provider your-provider`.

See the docstring in `llm_providers.py` for a complete example skeleton.

## Before every PR

1. **Run all unit tests and verify they pass:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```
   All tests must pass. Do not create or update a PR with failing tests.
2. **If you added or changed code, add or update unit tests** in `tests/`.
   New functions need test coverage. Changed behavior needs updated assertions.
3. Run `python3 generate_results.py --all` and verify no errors.
4. **Check for counter-gap discrepancies** in the generated `results.md` files.
   If any "Probable counter gaps" appear, fix them in `test_quality.py` before
   merging (see "LLM vs structural discrepancy checks" above). Qualitative
   disagreements are expected — verify the LLM justification is coherent.
5. Verify all import paths work: `python3 -c "from runner import main"`.
6. Spot-check a few numbers in results.md against raw metrics.json.
7. If you changed architecture or findings, update this file (`AGENTS.md`).
8. If you added files or moved things, update the Files table in `README.md`.

## Current state (2026-04-13)

### v4 benchmark — complete, task 14 archived

64/64 runs finished (8 tasks x 4 modes x 2 models). Results in
`results/2026-04-09_152435/`. Zero failures, zero timeouts, zero
double-result bugs. Total cost $86.90, avg 8.6min/run.

v4 added trap-awareness guidance from v3 findings, `shell: pwsh` for
PowerShell mode, "limit to 3 act push" instruction, and a custom act
Docker image with pwsh/Pester pre-installed. This cut average run time
by 24% vs v3 (8.6min vs 11.4min).

Post-v4 analysis found Task 14 (Docker Image Tag Generator) redundant
with Task 16 (Environment Matrix Generator) across TQ scores, cost, and
duration profiles. Task 14 was archived — see `archived-tasks/`. Future
runs use 7 tasks (11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18) x 4 modes x 2 models = 56 runs.

### Key findings (v4)

- Opus is faster than Sonnet across all modes.
- Default mode always chooses Python.
- PowerShell/sonnet is the slowest and most expensive combo.
- TypeScript hooks have ~50% catch rate but are net negative for Opus
  (tsc --noEmit takes 12-21s per Write on large files) and net positive
  for Sonnet (smaller writes, 2-3s per check).
- PowerShell hooks catch almost nothing (0-4% rate) — net negative.
- v4 trap-awareness guidance eliminated the timeout and double-result
  bugs that occurred in v3.

### Earlier versions

- v3: `results/2026-04-08_192624/` — 64 runs, same tasks/modes/models as v4. Had 1 timeout, 3 double-result bugs. Avg 11.4min/run.
- v2: `results/2026-04-07_225702/` — 111/144 runs. 18 tasks, modes: default/powershell/powershell-strict/csharp-script. Superseded by v3.
- v1: `results/2026-04-02_163146/` — 144 runs, same as v2. Had permission-denial artifacts (88% of errors).
- See `design-and-planning-artifacts/` for historical analysis and planning docs.
